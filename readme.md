GitHub seems to want a readme file, so here we go.
This is an [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction), also known as a text adventure game. Essentially it is a selective-your-own-adventure book for the computer age. And this is my first try.

The game itself is written with [Squiffy](https://github.com/textadventures/squiffy) and was inspired by [Signal from Mars](https://github.com/fadelakin/SFM). You can download Signal from Mars from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=interactive&fdid=com.fisheradelakin.interactivestory).

When this game is finshed, I will post the link to the finished product.

# ==This is a work in progress!!!==
